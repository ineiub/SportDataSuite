![marathon](/marathon.jpeg)

SDS is an advanced software suite developed in Java with the Eclipse framework, designed for the timing and analysis of sporting events. The platform stands out for its ability to integrate data from various sources, both hardware and software, to provide a complete and customizable experience.

**Key Features:**

* **Multi-channel Data Acquisition:** SDS imports real-time data from external timing equipment, MySQL databases, and heterogeneous data sources, including documents and other databases.
* **Data Processing and Analysis:** The software processes the acquired data, applying complex algorithms to generate detailed analyses and in-depth statistics.
* **Visualization and Reporting:** SDS creates intuitive graphical visualizations and customized reports, including rankings, results, and relevant information for organizers, athletes, media (television graphics), and internal analysis.
* **Flexible Data Export:** The platform allows data export in various formats, to meet the needs of different stakeholders.
* **Online Communication:** SDS integrates APIs for online communication, facilitating data exchange and integration with other systems.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

* Having inherited a decade-old project, the main challenge was optimizing and updating the software to ensure its efficiency and stability over time.
* To address this challenge, a process of code review, library updates, and database optimization was implemented.
* At the end of the working period a decision was made to rewrite the software using the dotNet framework with the C sharp language.

**Impact:**

SDS has provided a reliable and scalable solution for sports data management, improving the efficiency of timing and analysis processes and providing valuable information for athletes, organizers, and media.

**Demonstrated Skills:**

* Java software development with the Eclipse framework.
* MySQL database management.
* API integration for online communication.
* Analysis and optimization of legacy software.
* Knowledge of software rewrite processes.
* Management of complex software projects.
